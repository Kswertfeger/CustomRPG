# CustomRPG

This project is a java text based RPG where the user can create a character, chose a class and make important story decisions.

# GAMEPLAY

The goal is to have comabt encounters where the user will need to make decions on what to do in combat with the options being broken
down into a few categories:

Offense: Moves/Abilites that will harm the opponent
Defense: Moves/Abilites to reduce incoming damage or boost your damage
Support: Moves/Abilites that can heal

# NPC/STORY

I want the player's decisions to matter as well as give the player a guided experience without telling them what to do.

There will be dialogue options with every NPC and depending on the options you chose it could change the outcome of the story
or the NPC's opinion of you. 

# THE BAD

Currently none of the core gameplay is completed, this project may be revisited to complete the features I wanted to add. 
The only thing currently Available is character creation.
